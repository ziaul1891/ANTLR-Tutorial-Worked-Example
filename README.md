# ANTLR-Tutorial-Worked-Example

Need to put the file in drive C

// Always use the name "libs" for the folder where you want to put the jar file
// I used JavaSE JDK 1.8 from Project Nmae-> Right Click-> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Library -> "Execution Environment" 
// Imported grun.bat, antlr.bat, jar file, "C:\Javalib\Workspace\AntlrExampleVisitor\src" and "C:\Javalib\Workspace\AntlrExampleVisitor\libs"  location to my classpath (Advanced System Settings --> Advanced --> Environment Variables)
