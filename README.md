# ANTLR-Tutorial-Worked-Example

At first, I need to put the file in drive C

1. I put my Workspace (Eclipse) inside the Javalib. </br>
2. Always use the name "libs" for the folder where you want to put the jar file. Keeping it "lib" may conflict. </br>
3. I used JavaSE JDK 1.8 from Project Nmae-> Right Click-> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Library -> "Execution Environment" </br>
4. Imported grun.bat, antlr.bat, jar file, "C:\Javalib\Workspace\AntlrExampleAction\src" and "C:\Javalib\Workspace\AntlrExampleAction\libs"  location to my classpath (Advanced System Settings --> Advanced --> Environment Variables --> USER Variables) </br>
5. In the PATH (System Variables), I added "C:\Javalib", "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15\bin"
6. In the PATH (USER Variables), I added "C:\Javalib", "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15\bin" and "%CLASSPATH%"
